# Turing Yearbook

Turing Yearbook is the first project of Module 3 in the Front End Engineering Program at the Turing School. This solo project is the first students build in React. It also serves as the introduction to Jest and Enzyme for unit testing of methods,  changes to state, and snapshot comparisons.

This application was built with `create-react-app`.
